### schbench is a latency measurement benchmark that uses a mix of worker and
### messaging threads. The worker threads wait for messages to come in which
### include a timestamp of when they were queued and records how long it took
### to receive the message. The message threads send messages and sleep for
### a small random amount of time in between. The benchmark reports quartiles
### of wakeup times of the worker threads with a specific interest in the
### worse-case outliers.
###
### In this configuration, the number of threads is bound by the size of a
### NUMA node to minimise the chances that delays reported are due to
### remote access latencies.
