### hackbench a general scheduler benchmark and stress test that is
### sensitive to regressions in the scheduler fast-path. It creates groups
### of threads or processes (depending on configuration) that communicate
### via pipes or sockets (depending on configuration).
###
### Note that while hackbench is often considered to be a scheduler benchmark,
### it is particularly weak when used with pipes. Given multiple senders and
### receivers sharing pipes that are unsynchronised, it is dominated heavily
### by a mutex protecting the pipe structures and a spinlock protecting the
### queue for wakeups. A significant percentage of time is spend acquiring
### and releasing those locks as well as the inevitable bounces of cache
### line data as waker/wakee processes do not run on the same CPUs but
### instead select CPUs that are nearby during wakeups.
